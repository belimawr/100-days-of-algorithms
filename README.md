100 Days of Algorithms
======================

There is a while since I'm looking for a project or something to keep me coding every day something
to myself and publishing it under the GPL license, however my biggest problem always was what to do.
Too many ideas, too many options.... I never decided and the time kept going on...

So inspired by [100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) by Tomáš Bouda
and the [100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) I decided to do something similar, but without
that huge constraint of having to code every single day. Let's be fair, the end of the year holidays
are coming, I'm going to travel, I might be without internet access for a few days. So I'm challenging
myself to write a 100 algorithms/pieces of code in 150 days without no more than two days in a row
without coding.

The implementations are not meant to be the best one, they just need to work, the constraints are:

* It must read from stdin, execute the algorithm and output to stdout
* There must be unit tests
* The code coverage must be 100% (except for the ``main.go`` file)

-----------------
Unfortunately I'm not having enough free time to keep going with this challenge :/
Writing some code/algorithm every day with unit-tests and a nice read-me takes a few
hours, specially when it's not an algorithm that I use often.


So I'll have to stop here. It was a great experience and I hope to add more thoughts to
this repository in the future.
